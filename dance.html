    <h1> The Perfect Dancer Is You </h1>
    <p> More then you relaize, many of our favorite models and dancers aren't as perfect as they seem. </p>  
    <p> Did you know that the average age of retirement for a dancer is, around 40 years of age. Dancer don't have a very long carier, concluding in them starting at a very young age and pushing their abilities to the limit.</p>
    <p> Dancers can develop a very serios disease called anorexia a lack or loss of appetite for food (as a medical condition/ an emotional disorder characterized by an obsessive desire to lose weight by refusing to eat. Most dancers devolp anorexia after the media, showing a definiton of what a dancer should look like. Extremly slim with little weight just to keep the size of the "perfect dancer".This is not just a major problem that usually occurs with ballet dancer but  ith all dancer and even models. Some dance teachers also provoke anorexia or similair behavior. Anorexia can lead to starvation or even worse death. Thankfully most dancers avoid the popular media belief and stay strong and healthy. <br> In addition not everyone is as slim as a stick, some people tend to have more weight then others but that is completly okay. We are all different if we were all the media dancers then no one would be able to challenge the popular belief and make history. </p>
